# INGV FiniteSource

An Android mobile application written in Kotlin to navigate a scientific catalog of international
erathquakes.

## Introduction

The main goal of the application is to provide an alternative and intuitive experience for accessing
the content of the INGV Extended Source web page on mobile devices.

The web page offers a catalog of earthquakes with scientific data, such as deformation scenarios and
extended source information.

The application introduces an optimized interface for touchscreen devices and adopts an ergonomic
design, aiming to significantly enhance the user experience in exploring the earthquake catalog.

What sets the application apart is the implementation of an interactive web-GIS environment,
allowing users to navigate events in the catalog with greater precision, integrating information
within a map-based context.
